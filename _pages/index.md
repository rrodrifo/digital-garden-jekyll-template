# Bem Vind@! üå±

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #9fffb2; border-radius: 4px;">
  "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life."

Henry David Thoreau, Walden.

It was with these words that Thoreau justified his escape from civilization in search of ethical self-sufficiency in nature. In this same sense, the idea of Digital Gardens arises‚Äîspaces set in opposition to social networks and platforms that extensively suck the marrow of our lives to generate data and, above all, profit. In response to platforms that throw our lives, personal relationships, feelings, and worldviews into an aggressive and accelerated loop designed to exploit our vulnerabilities, making us addicted to generating content, clicks, and data, Digital Gardens offer places of pause and reflection, of independence and autonomy.


The purpose of this Garden is personal. My garden is a place to plant thoughts, links, and inspirations on a wide range of topics that come to mind, composed of seeds, already-germinated ideas, long, complex, and tangled rhizomes, and perhaps, who knows, a tree or two.

This garden is, above all, a collection of my reading notes and reflections.
> ‚ÄúThese latter notes are often, in academic tradition, discarded or archived after being converted into text, whether a book or an article. A tradition that privileges bringing to the public‚Äîand consequently to collective debate, reflection, and knowledge‚Äîonly the so-called results of research activity. In the words of Bruno Latour and Michel Callon (1991), a tradition that favors finished science over science in the making. The instruments with which we do science and produce knowledge‚Äînotes, inscriptions, tests, etc.‚Äîare usually left backstage, given only limited visibility within restricted circuits. The exclusive publication of finished science is also a relative concealment of the way science is made. This argument, certainly, can be extended to all research and knowledge production.‚Äù ‚Äî Fernanda Bruno, Machines of Seeing, Modes of Being (pp. 11-12).
