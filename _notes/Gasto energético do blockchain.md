title: Blockchain Energy Consumption
---

Although promising, blockchain technology must be analyzed carefully. This is due to its genuine potential to solve problems across various fields, but also because of all the marketing and even exaggerated or misleading claims about its potential. Additionally, considering the complexity of how blockchain operates, it is possible that some negative aspects of the technology have been overlooked, partly by academia but especially by the market.

The most significant of these negative aspects concerns the environmental impact caused by the development and expansion of blockchain, particularly regarding the energy consumption required to implement and maintain the technology.

To verify the authenticity of each block within a blockchain and to establish consensus and trust in the process's results, the main blockchain applications use a process called Proof-of-Work (PoW).

This process, in a simplified summary, involves a "race" among different "miners" who, using their computational power, participate in rounds where the first miner to successfully verify the authenticity of a data block receives a financial reward. 

This verification is achieved through "brute force" techniques, which aim to find the original value that, when encrypted through a hash function, matches the value provided in the block. The major issue with PoW techniques is that as the supply of the assets the blockchain aims to authenticate decreases—for instance, as the supply of Bitcoin diminishes relative to its demand—the computational power required for mining to remain profitable and yield results necessarily increases.

With the drastic rise in blockchain use between 2016 and 2018, there was an equally dramatic increase in the computational power needed to sustain the Proof-of-Work model, along with a sharp rise in the energy consumption required to keep the activity operational. 

For illustrative purposes, in 2016, each Bitcoin mined required an energy expenditure of 1,005 kWh. By June 2018, this figure had grown to 60,461 kWh per coin, representing an increase of over 60 times. As a result, Bitcoin mining alone in 2017 consumed more energy than countries like Ireland or Hong Kong.

This increase in energy consumption brings numerous environmental problems, with estimates suggesting that annual CO2 emissions related to blockchain mining exceed 20 tons. This issue also has severe impacts on public health.

The use of Proof-of-Work, although it continues to dominate the blockchain market—especially as it is used by the four leading cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero)—is already categorized by experts in the field as unsustainable. Ethereum itself, for example, has been working for over five years to develop alternatives to Proof-of-Work and implement new techniques.

Thus, if the industry seeks blockchain as a solution to its problems, it is also essential to recognize the inherent issues within blockchain itself. This includes the importance of developing sustainable alternatives for the technology, such as implementing other consensus methods like Proof-of-Stake, Delegated Proof-of-Stake, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, or even approaches that move away from decentralized consensus. These could rely on consensus standards based on trust in transparent certification authorities, following models like Google’s Certificate Transparency.

The development of solutions through blockchain must go hand in hand with creating environmentally sustainable consensus certification systems. This requires pursuing and investing in new blockchain alternatives and projects that focus on sustainability and environmental protection.
