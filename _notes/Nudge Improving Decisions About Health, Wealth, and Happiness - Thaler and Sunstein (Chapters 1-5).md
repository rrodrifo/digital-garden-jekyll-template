title: Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness - Thaler and Sunstein (Chapters 1-5)
---

- Choice Architecture: Organizes the context in which people make decisions. No design is neutral; even small details can significantly impact behavior.

- Libertarian Paternalism: Promotes liberty-preserving nudges, aiming to steer choices without removing options. It’s non-intrusive and seeks to improve lives through subtle influence rather than coercion.

- Nudges: Subtle interventions that influence behavior predictably without restricting options. These interventions must be easy and cheap to avoid and do not significantly alter economic incentives.

- Status Quo Bias: People tend to stick with default options. Default settings, chosen wisely, can lead to better outcomes in areas like health care, savings, and organ donation.

- Automatic vs. Reflective Thinking: Two systems guide decision-making — Automatic (intuitive) and Reflective (rational). Anchors and heuristics influence choices within the Automatic System.

- Anchoring and Availability Biases: Anchors set a starting point for decisions, and availability bias leads people to assess risks based on easily recalled examples.

- Unrealistic Optimism and Loss Aversion: People often underestimate risks due to optimism, while loss aversion nudges them to resist change even when beneficial. Framing information in terms of losses (rather than gains) is more effective.

- Social Influence: People conform to social norms due to informational influence (learning from others) and peer pressure. Public nudges leverage social influence to guide behavior.

- Mere-Measurement Effect & Priming: Asking people what they intend to do increases their likelihood to act. Visible cues or social nudges can prime behavior toward certain actions.

- Nudges and Choice Architecture: Nudges should aim to help and minimize harm, especially for decisions that are difficult, rare, or lack prompt feedback. People may benefit from nudges when they have trouble predicting the impact of their choices.


- Designing Effective Nudges:

- Benefits Now—Costs Later: Self-control issues arise when there is a time gap between choices and consequences.

- Degree of Difficulty & Frequency: Difficult and infrequent choices are prime candidates for nudging.

- Feedback: When feedback mechanisms fail, nudges can help.

- Knowing What You Like: Nudges assist when people struggle to foresee how choices affect their lives.

- Market Limitations: While competition often helps consumers, firms may exploit irrational beliefs. Competition is necessary to protect consumers, but sometimes it’s absent.

- Stimulus Response Compatibility: Actions should align with signals (e.g., a push door with a handle that suggests pulling leads to errors).

- Defaults: Many people stick with default options, even if they're not the best for them. Defaults can subtly influence choices but aren’t always beneficial.

- Required Choice: Mandating choices can be useful but may be seen as a burden. It’s more suitable for simple yes/no decisions.

- Feedback in Systems: Good systems give feedback to help people improve their decisions.

- Comprehensible Information: Information, especially on complex topics like credit cards or mortgages, should be made clear and relatable for consumers.

- Choice Strategies: People use simplifying strategies (e.g., “elimination by aspects”) when faced with many complex options, but these strategies can lead to mistakes.

- Incentives in Choice Architecture: Architects should carefully consider who uses, chooses, pays, and profits. Salience is key—people need to notice incentives.

- Six Principles of Good Choice Architecture:

  1. Incentives
  2. Understand mappings
  3. Defaults
  4. Give feedback
  5. Expect error
  6. Structure complex choices
