### Collection of class notes


By regulation, we mean regulation that tries to regulate behavior: 
It is an attempt to let persons behave in certain (desirable) ways or prevent them from behaving in certain (undesirable ways)
Behavior of both natural persons and legal persons
Regulation of behavior of robots and AI?

→ Narrow approach: a specific set of commands - command and control
→ Broader approach: deliberate state influence (all state actions designed to influence behavior)
→ Broadest approach: all forms of social or economic influence (all mechanisms that affect behavior, whether state-based or from other sources. Both intentional and unintentional effects)

Desirable behavior depends on perspective:
Legislators perspective
Parliaments perspective
Companies perspectives
Users perspectives
etc.

Command and Control Regulation (CAC)
The legal approach
Laws backed by sanctions
Direct regulation
By legislation
State what is permitted and what is illegal
Focus on compliance, enforcement and consequences/sanctions

Command and Control Regulation (C&C) (narrow approach)
Command and Control Regulation is regulation through laws backed by sanctions. 
Direct regulation made through legislations
States what is permitted and what is illegal
Focus on compliance, enforcement and consequences/sanctions
“The strengths of C & C regulation (as compared to techniques based, say, on the use of economic incentives such as taxes or subsidies) are that the force of law can be used to impose fixed standards with immediacy and to prohibit activity not conforming to such standards.”


→ Strengths:
Fixed standards
Possibility of strong enforcement
Possibility of quick responses
The regulator looks to be acting quickly

→ Weaknesses of CAC regulation?
Lobbies/revolving door (regulatory capture)
Legalism
Regulatees may focus on the black-letter law, rather than the intentions behind it
Compliance in theory but still the same actions in practice
Unintended consequences, standard-setting
Stifling competition and entrepreneurship. Over-regulation. Inflexible and complicated rules, standards may be hard to comply with
Enforcement 
Enforcement can be complicated and burdensome when there are more rules and more detailed rules

What is Regulation?
“The enterprise of subjecting human conduct to the governance of rules” L. Fuller (1964), The morality of Law
Setting rules and making sure that people comply with the rules. 
→ Narrow approach: a specific set of commands - command and control
→ Broader approach: deliberate state influence (all state actions designed to influence behavior)
→ Broadest approach: all forms of social or economic influence (all mechanisms that affect behavior, whether state-based or from other sources. Both intentional and unintentional effects)
Why regulate new technologies anyway?
To defend people’s rights, to direct the technology for some intended direction, to create legal certainty. 
The rules are necessary to make the system function as desired. 
According to Baldwin et. al:
Information inadequacies
Scarcity
Human Rights
Monopolies
Public good
Planning
etc; 
What are positive aspects of regulation?
Protect fundamental rights and freedoms
Reflect social norms and values also online
Increase trust, legal certainty
Create an open, level playing field
What are the negative aspects of (over) regulation?
too many rules or too detailed rules
Compliance burden
Inflexible and complicated rules
Limited/burdensome enforcement
Legalism: focus on rules rather than underlying goals (innovation, protection of human rights, etc.)

Rules can be restrictive or facilitating
Toolbox for regulation (Lessig):
The object of regulation can be regulated through four modalities:
Social norms
Market forces
Law and legislation
Environment (architecture and code)

The markets, laws and norms are part of the Socially-mediated regulation modalities. 

Design and architecture are environmentally-mediated regulation modalities.

Code is law. Code writers are increasingly larmakers. 

Speed Bumps are an example of environmentally-based regulation. 

Contrast between east coast code and west coast code:
Speed limit (command and control) vs. Speed bumps (architecture)
Walls, fences, locks, bars are all examples of environmentally-mediated regulation. 

A locked door is not a command. A locked door is a physical constraint of freedom. 
Techno-regulation:
Online examples of techno-regulation:
Encryption, firewalls
Gender boxes
Computing performance, maximum storage capacity
Accepting terms and conditions
Profile settings (pre-programmed)

Privacy by Design:
Design technology in such a way that privacy is protected automatically
Restricted queries, anonymization, blurring faces, etc. 

Strengths and Weaknesses of Techno-regulation:
Strengths:
Efficiente
Cheap
Foolproof 
Fair

Weaknesses:
Not legitimate
Not democratic
Not transparent
Not fair
Architecture designed unfair
Sometimes people should be treated differently rathar than the same (affirmative action, special need, etc. )
Erosion of moral agency:
Respond automatically
It makes us stupid

Key Characteristics of Techno- regulation:
Highly coercive
People must comply/no way to disobey
No room for maneuver
Nudging (Thaler & Sustein):
You can push behavior in the right direction by making desirable behavior more attractive, without limiting the freedom of choice of people
The goal is to (slightly) readjust behavior via choice architecture

Examples of online nudging:
Default settings
Personalization
Attractive offers
Opt-in versus opt-out

Default settings in software are powerful (5-10% change)
Libertarian paternalism?
Nudging can have illegitimate motives
Nudge can act as deception method
There is a lack of transparency in nudging
→ Libertarian paternalism is the idea that it is both possible and legitimate (for private and public institutions) to influence behavior while also respecting freedom of choice. 

Nudges can be more or less transparent and also invoke reflection and not invoke reflection

State regulation:
Advantages:
Clear centralize process
Setting uniform standards
nation-wide scope
transparency
Based on democratic principles
Checks and Balances


Disadvantages:
Who is at the table?
Bureaucracy
Costly
Transparency
Regulation may be too general or over regulation

Self-regulation:
Actors can regulate themselves
Codes of conduct
Certifications
Erc. 
Intersubjective reference framework:
All the partners that will decide the rules have subjective perceptions and perspectives. The end of the intersubjective reference framework is to make a decision on regulation that reflects most of the subject’s principles and objectives. 

Advantages:
Good PR for industry
No costs for external enforcement
Avoid reputational damage
Setting your own norms may lead to better compliance
Disadvantages:
Conflict of interest may lead to failure
Enforcement may be weak
Scope may be limited
Focus may be on business interests rather than consumer/citizen interest




Why self-regulate:
The subjects of self-regulation already have the expertise on the field
It may also be more efficient than C&C
Mandates
Increased level of accountability
Fairness of procedures

Technology-neutral legislation
Legislation not formulated specifically for technologies, but for:
Groups of technologies
Applications of technologies
Functionality of technologies
How?
Different phrasing
Different, sometimes wider scope

Examples:
EU data protection law
regulating personal data and data processing, not computers or databases
Stand-alone databases to (online) interconnected databases
EU e-commerce directive
regulates information society services, not online shops or buying online
Online shops sometimes no longer have offline shops
Some online services are for free
Convention on Cybercrime:
computer systems, not computer, desktop, or laptop
Internet connection also via smartphones, for example


Advantages:
Sustainable legislation
Changes are not always immediately necessary
Legislation is more general
May include new technologies

Disadvantages:
Limited legal certainty
General norms, latent ambiguity
Not all new technological developments are foreseeable/predicable


Technology-neutral legislation is NOT vague legislation. Vague legislation is simply flawed legislation. 
Technology-neutral legislation uses different phrasing and may have a broader (but still clear!) scope 


→ Do laws directed at tech companies serve as examples of technology-neutral legislation? No, if it's not directed at the technology it is not technology-neutral legislation. 

Complicating factors for regulation:
Dematerialization
Shift to other layers of regulation
Different angles of regulation, regulating not the devices but the data, for example
Example: phones are even smaller
The device doesn’t need to store information, it only needs to access data storage (cloud)
Things getting smaller makes them less visible
 Technology is moved to the background
Internationalisation
Technologies developed in different countries
Drafting new rules
Enforcing rules 
Data Colonization
Technological turbulence
Technology development is exponential, so the “next step” is unpredictable
New technologies
New applications
Privatisation
Most of the technology is being created by private actors
Different landscape for regulation compared to “classic” government control
Balance between self-regulation and top-down regulation by the State
Self-regulating

Where would you regulate:
Prohibition of child pornography?
Content layer → define what child pornography is and set rules accordingly
Code/application layer → child pornography is usually in the “dark web”, so an option is to prohibit the software and applications that give access to the sites
Physical layer → harder, but could be blocked based on country for example. 
→ What is the option when the prohibition is in the ISP? Is it the link layer?

4 different issues/challenges:
Latent ambiguity
Do written laws mentioning privacy of correspondence, telephone and telegraphs also apply to e-mail and video-calls without the law being updated?
Literalism vs. teleological interpretation
Gramatical (literal) interpretation: NO
Teleological interpretation: YES
In the Netherlands the interpretation was literal, so the constitution was updated in 2023:
“Everyone has the right to privacy of correspondence and telecommunication” → technology-neutral phrasing
Technology develops faster than law
Initially, the regulation is clear, but in a later stage, interpretation issues emerge, for instance, due to new technologies. 
‘applying old rules to new situations’
Not only applies to technology (for example same-sex marriage in Brasil)

Competing sovereigns
Dematerialization + internationalization
Sovereignty 
Establishing rules
Enforcing rules
	
Example of competing sovereignty:
The US government wants to have access to all personal data of passengers of planes coming into the US. This clashed with the EU’s regulation on personal data protection. What to do?

Example on enforcement:
The Dutch public prosecution service wants to prosecute a Russian hacker for distributing ransomware in the Netherlands. Russia does not want to extradite. What to do?


Regulability/Anonymity
Who is doing what and where?
Regulation must be concrete, it is also an enforcement problem
Attribution problems:
Who is behind a particular IP-address?
Who created a specific malware?
To whom does an e-mail address belong?

Property/ownership
Who owns the internet?
Who owns the hardware and the software?
Who owns the data in Cloud computing?
→ EULA and Terms of Use?

Exercise
Gambling Company
Explain to the Board of Directors that if the EU Commission wants to use a Lessigian approach for regulating gambling it will probably cover actions to nudge the market, the social norms, the architecture and legislation. 

The possible actions could be:
Market:
Taxes on gambling profits, off-shore tax reform
→ money laundering
Price ceiling
Social norms:
Campaigns against gambling
Education
Health campaign to try to help with gambling addiction
Architecture:
Demand ISP providers to block access to The River Flop Five website
Promote use of VPN, change IP address and create different websites
Demand the app is taken down from app store and google play store
Create public commotion against this measure
Enforce control over gambling age via identity requirements
Claim this infringes on personal freedom and creates a burden on the end-to-end principle if used on the ISP layer
Set timers and limits to the amount of money spent by user


Legislation:
Ban the advertisement of gambling platforms in different medias or completely
→ Hire advertisement in social media through influencers, covert advertising
→ Lobbying against the legislation based on free-market libertarian ideologies, campaign that the legislation is going to diminish freedom online and 
Demand the company to have legal representatives in the EU
Legislation on taxes for the company and the user


Tax evasion, money laundering, create different companies 

Critique on Lessig
Cyberlibertarians vs. cyberpaternalists
Key questions from previous lectures:
Should you regulate?
Can it be regulated?
Which aspects should be regulated?
Who should regulate?
Where should regulation take place?


Cyberlibertarianism:
Maximizing autonomy
Freedom
Freedom of expression
Free trade
Civil Rights
Self-regulation (minimal state)

Key proponents:
John Perry Barlow
David Johnson and David Post



Key Thesis:
Laws are constrained by borders, the internet is not
Law could never be effective in cyberspace
Cyberspace cannot be regulated


Cyberpaternalism:
Put controls in place
Create a safe environment
Promote people’s own good
More focus on well-being than on welfare


Key proponents:
Jack Goldsmith
Yochai Benkler
Joel Reidenberg
Lawrence Lessig

Key Thesis:
Cyberspace is controlled by code used to create environment
Regulation through code is always effective (control through design)
Cyberspace is perfectly regulable






Defining regulation:
Lessig:
Broader approach; “regulability means the capacity of a government to regulate behavior within its proper reach”
Murray (network communitarianism):
Broadest approach; “All forms of social control, state and non-state, intended and unintended”

Examples of problems in Lessig’s model:
Law:
Regulated by sanctions
The sanctions are always ex post, which may not prevent certain behaviours
Social Norms:
How one ought to behave
Who decides? What if a community does not engage in feedback?


Lawmakers have had to resort to indirect regulation through mandated code designs:
In the US: Communications Decency Act, The Child On-Line Protection Act, The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
In Europe: Electronic Signatures Directive, Copyright & Related Rights in the Information Society Directive, etc. 

→ This does not fit into Lessig’s model: is it regulation by law or by code? (Both)

Who determines the nature of cyber-regulatory settlements?	
Usually the company and developers
Question of Legitimacy

Are architectural controls too unforgiving?
No need for separate detectors and effectors?
No way for the user to add to the design, you either accept it and use it or you don’t use it at all

Are code-makers too US-centric?


Murray & Scott
More focus on accountability:
Maybe Lessig does not focus enough in the level of accountability
Obligation to give account of one’s actions to someone else
Often balanced with responsibilities of others

Lack of accountability is fatal to the concept of design controls as a regulatory modality

Lack of human interaction found in design control negates accountability

Network communitarianism

Examines the problems of online regulation from a different perspective rto Lessig and the Digital Realist or Cyberpaternalist School
Checar Slides

Cyberspace environment is not analogous with physical environment of real space
People (companies, users) respond to regulation, to social norms, to architecture.
Moving jurisdictions online
VPNs
Changing product or company
Circumvent methods

Lessig’s pathetic dot becomes Murray’s active dot inside of a network, not alone

From control to community?
To many regulators see the community as ‘the problem’
Peer-to-peer
DRM engineering
Reselling
Parallel Importation
Attempts are made to control community
Community seen as passive. Communitarians disagree, they want to introduce the opinion and suggestions of the community to the regulatory process
Failure to force change = regulatory failure
Active community
Opportunity to harness community regulation

Symbiotic Regulation:
Checar Slides

Laidlaw:
proposed regulatory gravity
Players are not equal, some of them have more gravity (gatekeepers such as ISP providers, the government, special interest groups, Platforms)
Single individuals can make impact in numbers even without gravity

Gatekeeper theory
Platforms on the Internet
Powerful gatekeepers regarding the information that is provided
Selection, filtering, editing, personalisation, blocking, content moderation, curation, ways of presentation
Construction of the Algorithm
Facilitating or hindering fundamental rights

Gatekeepers are a good starting point for regulation
Digital Services Act (DSA):
VLOPs = Very Large Online Platform (17 in 2023)
VLOSEs = Very Large Online Search Engines (2 in 2023)
Digital Markets Act (DMA):
Gatekeeper = core platform
Core platform services: search engines, social networks, etc. 
Exercise
“Territorial laws are unable to effectively regulate Cyberspace”

Discuss this from the following perspectives:
Cyberlibertarian Perspective
Governments shouldn’t regulate. Governments have no moral right to rule cyberspace nor the methods of enforcement necessary to rule. Complete independence between territorial law and cyberspace regulation, which means the ‘real world States’ have no authority over cyberspace, no legitimacy and no consent. Internet design and architecture make regulation impossible
Cyperpaternalist perspective
Cyberpaternalists believe that it is necessary to regulate in order to maintain values
However, cyberpaternalists such as Lessig believe that other means of regulation are necessary or even more effective;
Network Communitarianism
Regulation is effective as long as its embraced by the community
Regulation can be effective if it is directed at the gatekeepers, for example
However, communitarianists also consider the different means of regulation other than law
Rational actor model
Homo economicus (Econs)
THe model takes in consideration the notion that human beings act rationally, through rational decision-making processes 
This doesn’t take in account the fact that our brains take shortcuts, use biases, etc. 

People tend to make options:
Out of convenience 
Considerably more likely to accept pre-selected choice options
Decisions are dependant on context
Based on biases and misjudgement

‘Display Induced Decision Bias’
Studies show that the display of a screen can change the focus of the user.
Adaptive technologies and A/B testing are examples of how the display induced decision bias is used by companies to nudge users/consumers 
Challenges of Online environments:

Differences in structure and functionality 
Network size
permanence
personalization
power of design
Differences in perception and behavior
Social cues and Communication 
Cues for epistemic quality
Social Calibration 
Self-disclosure vs. privacy
Norms of Civility
Dissolution of Shared Perceptions

Attention Economy
Challenge to attention and cognitive control
The digital environments have been optimized to monopolize and comodigy human attention and online behaviors
Choice architectures
Strategic design of online environments and user interfaces to affect people’xs choices in order to steer behavior
Persuasive and manipulative choice architectures thath steer in service of commercial interests (privacy-intruding default settings)
Algorithmic Curated Content
AI-powered algorithmic tools that filter/meduate information online
Dissolutions of shared perceptions
Misinformation and Disinformation 

Psychological insights 
behavioral economics 
our brains have two different systems
System 1 - intuitive question (fast)
System 2 - rational thinking (slow)

Heuristics 
Strategies for:
Making judgements
Making decisions 
Finding solutions
We can use both parts of the brain, depending on the kinds of decisions we need to make

We have great brains, but prone to bias

2 Schools of Heuristics:
Fast and Frugal:
Optimistic in nature
Modular heuristics
Focus on when is it appropriate to leave information out
Heuristic strategies
Heuristics and Biases
Humans have limited computational capacities
Pessimistic in nature
Susceptible to making poor judgments resulting in systematic biases and errors

Examples of biases:
Availability bias
People tend to overestimate probabilities when they know an specific example of something

Representativeness bias
If two objects or events are similar we assume their frequency is similar
Representative bias in courts are problematic
Anchoring and Adjustment bias
Start information
The information with which you start a thinking pattern can change the results

New online specific errors and biases?
- Online we do not have enough information to make fully informed choices, which make fully rational decisions online impossible

Network effect bias
Visual preference heuristic
People like seeing images over more complete text-based descriptions
Data authenticity bias?
Too much reliance on data from digital resources and digital tools
Always over-value way data is presented in any decision-making process

Dark patterns: extremely manipulative online architecture 
shape and prompt user behavior 
benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions 
choosing lenient privacy settings to increase user engagement 
Misdirection, applying social pressure, inciting sense of urgency and scarcity
