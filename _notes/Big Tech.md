- [[Essential Platforms - Nikolas Guggenberger]]:

> A long article (83 pages) by Nikolas Guggenberger in which the author compares 21st-century digital platforms with early 20th-century monopolies, such as railway companies.
For the author, just like the railway network, the infrastructure developed by digital platforms serves as an essential resource for the 21st-century digital economy.
> Based on this, the author presents the possibility of reviving the "Essential Facilities Doctrine," a legal doctrine used to open markets and prevent abuses by railway monopolies. Among the ideas proposed for applying this doctrine in the 21st century are interoperability between platforms, prohibition and enforcement to prevent discrimination, and self-promotion of platforms.
