title: Law and Borders - The Rise of Law in Cyberspace
---

- Cyberspace transcends geographic borders, undermining the effectiveness of laws based on territorial boundaries.

- Traditional legal authority struggles to regulate online behavior, as online actions are detached from physical locations.

- Efforts to impose local laws on global online activities are impractical, particularly for countries involved in global commerce.

- Jurisdictional challenges arise because it's unclear which laws govern activities in cyberspace, leading to proposals to treat Cyberspace as a separate "place" for legal analysis.

- Self-regulation in Cyberspace was originally favored, but the rise of Big Tech has shifted the focus towards government regulation of these companies, rather than regulating the internet itself. 

- Online rule-making should prioritize understanding the unique nature of cyberspace and avoid excessive interference by local governments, unless it concerns localized vital interests.
