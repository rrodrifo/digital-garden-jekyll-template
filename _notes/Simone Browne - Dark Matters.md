title: Simone Browne - Dark Matters
---

A obra "Dark Matters" publicada por Simone Browne em 2015 rapidamente se tornou uma dos mais importantes e influentes estudos acerca dos Surveillance Studies. Ao envolver sua revisão completa dos textos seminais da área de estudos com seu recorte racial, a autora reestrutura as discussões acerca dos modelos panópticos e pós-panópticos de maneira a revolucionar seus significados e potencialidades de compreensão. Uma vez desvelado, o poder exercido pelos mecanismos de controle racial em cima dos mecanismos de vigilânicias não pode ser mais ignorado, motivo pelo qual o presente texto, ainda que recente, já se torna leitura obrigatória que deve influenciar todos os estudos sobre vigilância posteriores à sua publicação. 


Browne se utiliza de diversos mecanismos didáticos para demonstrar como os dispositivos de vigilância moderno são indissociáveis do policiamento e perseguição da população negra durante e após a escravidão. 


Um exemplo de como a inserção desta chave de compreensão modifica a nossa compreensão acerca destes dispositivos e escancara a incompletude de qualquer análise dos dispositivos de vigilância que não considere a dimensão do racismo na formulação e implementação da vigilância é o caso do Panóptico de Bentham. 


Nos meios acadêmicos se atribui à releitura do panóptico de Bentham por Foucault o surgimento dos chamados “Surveillance Studies”, ou estudos sobre vigilância, como disciplina autônoma. Porém, Browne nos demonstra que, antes mesmo do surgimento do panóptico ou mesmo da prisão moderna em solo europeu, tecnologias de vigilância estruturadas de maneira moderna e buscando a ubiquidade já eram impostas aos corpos negros que eram escravizados, fato que é exacerbado pela comparação da planta do navio negreiro Brooks com a planta das prisões em formato panóptico desenvolvida por Bentham, ou pela constatação de que o utilitarista inglês havia passado os anos anteriores ao desenvolvimento do panóptico estudando e comentando os métodos de tortura, punição e vigilância impostos aos escravizados em seus diários e cartas com seu irmão. 


Apresento aqui algumas citações da obra de Browne que considero relevantes:

> “Fanon put forth the idea that modernity can be characterized by the “mise en fiches de l’homme.” These are the records, files, time sheets, and identity documents that together form a biography, and sometimes an unauthorized one, of the modern subject.”

> “Although Fanon’s remarks on cctv surveillance are short, they are revealing as he suggests that these cameras are trained not only on the potential thief, but also on the employee working on the shop floor who is put on notice that the video surveillance is perpetual. He also noted that workers displayed microresistances to managerial control in the way of sick leave, expressing boredom on the job, arriving late, and sometimes not arriving at work at all. Rather than being thought of as unproductive, such acts must be understood as disalienating, as they are strategic means of contesting surveillance in the workplace.”

> “Lyon has argued that the “surveillance society” as a concept might be misleading, for it suggests “a total, homogeneous situation of being under surveillance” rather than a more nuanced understanding of the sometimes discreet and varying ways that surveillance operates.”

> “My use of the term “racializing surveillance” signals those moments when enactments of surveillance reify boundaries, borders, and bodies along racial lines, and where the outcome is often discriminatory treatment of those who are negatively racialized by such surveillance.”

> “John Gilliom and Torin Monahan, in their analysis of social media sites such as Facebook, argue that “rather than being a prisonlike panopticon where trapped people follow the rules because they’re afraid someone is watching, with Facebook and similar sites people are probably more afraid that no one is watching, that no one cares what they’re up to.”  With this apparent fear of not being noticed, Gilliom and Monahan say that social media users “discipline themselves in a different way by divulging as much as possible about their lives and thoughts.”

> “Talking back is, as hooks puts it, “the expression of our movement from object to subject” and a “gesture of defiance that heals, that makes new life and new growth possible.”  Talking back, then, is one way of challenging surveillance and its imposition of norms.”

> “Biometric information technology, or biometrics, in its simplest form, is a means of body measurement that is put to use to allow the body, or parts and pieces and performances of the human body, to function as identification”
> “Epidermalization, Paul Gilroy tells us, stems from “a historically specific system for making bodies meaningful by endowing in them qualities of ‘colour.’”
> “Epidermalization, Stuart Hall writes, is “literally the inscription of race on the skin.”
> “I am taking epidermalization here as the moment of fracture of the body from its humanness, refracted into a new subject position (“Look, a Negro!” or “Look, an illegal alien!” or some other negatively racialized subject position). In other words, it is the moment of contact with the white gaze — a moment where, as Fanon describes, “all this whiteness burns me to a cinder” — that produces these moments of fracture for the racial Other, indeed making and marking one as racial Other, experiencing its “being for others.”
> “with biometrics it is the moments of observation, calibration, and application that sometimes reveal themselves as racializing."
> If, as Gilroy suggests, the pseudoscientific enterprise of truth seeking in racial difference can be more fully comprehended through the Fanonian concept of epidermalization,  how can epidermalization, as a concept, be made useful at a scale of the body made biometric? I suggest here that we come to think of the concept of digital epidermalization when we consider what happens when certain bodies are rendered as digitized code, or at least when attempts are made to render some bodies as digitized code.”

> “In Slavery and Social Death: A Comparative Study, Orlando Patterson explains that slave branding “backfired” in Brazil, where the letter F that branded a recaptured runaway was “proudly displayed” to the “more cautious but admiring fellow sufferers,” marking its resignification as a mark of honor, not of capture.”

> “What Gordon insightfully calls the “notion of white prototypicality” is the enabling condition of the structured violence of “the dialectics of recognition.” 

> “The absence of a nuanced discussion of how such racial thinking shapes the research and development of contemporary biometric information technology is itself constitutive of power relations existing in that very technology, where the idea of blackness is invoked (think actor Will Smith) to reproduce power relations, even sometimes in the physical absence of actual black people.”
