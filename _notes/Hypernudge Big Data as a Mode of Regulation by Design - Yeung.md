[[Nudge Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness - Thaler and Sunstein (Chapters 1-5)]]

- Big Data & Algorithms: Big Data combines technology and processes to analyze unstructured data using machine learning, converting data into actionable knowledge.

- Nudge Theory: Big Data-driven decision-making relies on a design mechanism known as ‘nudge,’ influencing individual decisions to serve commercial interests.

- Hypernudging: This technique uses real-time feedback loops and algorithmic correlations to dynamically influence users’ decisions by shaping their informational environment.

- Big Data’s Manipulative Power:

- Active manipulation: Critics argue that nudges can be used for illegitimate purposes.

- Passive manipulation: Nudges exploit cognitive weaknesses, potentially deceiving users.

- Transparency concerns: Hypernudging is often opaque, with algorithms hidden behind trade secrets.


- Privacy Self-Management Issues: The "transparency paradox" and the complexity of data flows undermine informed consent in the Big Data environment.

- Regulatory Governance: Systematic control aimed at managing risks and behaviors to achieve public objectives, often through automated or digital decision guidance processes.

- Algorithmic Control: Big Data operates subtly, using personalized decision-making environments to control behavior in a “soft” but pervasive manner.

- Criticism of Liberal Autonomy: The liberal emphasis on notice and consent overlooks how Big Data manipulates individuals through hyperpersonalized digital environments.

- Threats to Democracy: Big Data surveillance and decision-making influence can erode democratic self-governance by modulating the informational landscape outside users' control.
